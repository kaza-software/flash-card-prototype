# Welcome to Wordx!

We're building an app designed to help you learn a new language in a practical and personalized way â€” tailored to the vocabulary you encounter in your daily life.

Our learning method combines the core features of a bilingual dictionary with the memorization power of flashcards. This allows you to create personalized decks using words you've come across while studying, relaxing, or during any other exposure to the target language.
